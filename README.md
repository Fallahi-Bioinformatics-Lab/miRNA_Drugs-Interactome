## miRNA-Drug interaction analysis



Micro-RNAs(miRNAs) are involved in many aspects of cancer including progression and drug-resistance. In this prohject we are trying to extract the intercations between micorRNAs and their tragets upon development of drug resistance. Our aim is to identify those miRNAs that could be used as biomarkers to assess development of Drug-resistance foloowing differnt therapies.
